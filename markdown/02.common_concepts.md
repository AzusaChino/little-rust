# Common Concepts

## variables

1. `let` defines immutable variables
2. `let mut` defines mutable variables
3. declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, which creates a new binding.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a_number = 10;
    let a_boolean = true;

    println!("The number is {}.", a_number);
    println!("The boolean is {}.", a_boolean);

    // Error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable
    a_number = 15;
    println!("Now the number is {}." , a_number);

    let mut b_number = 10;
    b_number = 15; // OK
    let a_number = 13; // ok
}
```

## data type

Rust is a statically typed language.

### Numbers

i8 - u8, i16 - u16, i32 - u32, i64 - u64, i128 - u128, isize - usize | f32, f64

The isize and usize types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on. The 64-bit type is used on a 64-bit architecture, and the 32-bit type on a 32-bit architecture. If you don't specify the type for an integer, and the system can't infer the type, it assigns the i32 type (a 32-bit signed integer) by default.

```rust
let x = 2.0;      // f64, default type
let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32, via type annotation

// Addition
println!("1 + 2 = {}", 1u32 + 2);

// Subtraction
println!("1 - 2 = {}", 1i32 - 2);
// ^ Try changing `1i32` to `1u32` to see why the type is important

// Integer Division
println!("9 / 2 = {}", 9u32 / 2);

// Float Division
println!("9 / 2 = {}", 9.0 / 2.0);

// Multiplication
println!("3 * 6 = {}", 3 * 6)
```

### Booleans

true, false

```rs
let is_bigger = 1 > 4;
println!("{}", is_bigger);
```

### Characters and Strings

Rust has two string types and one character type. All of them are valid UTF-8 representations.

char, str, String

```rs
let c = 'z';
let c = 'Z';
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';

let mut hello = String::from("Hello, ");
hello.push('w');
hello.push_str("orld!");
println!("{}", hello);
```

### Tuples

```rs
("Hello", 5i32, 'c');
assert_eq!(tuple.0, "hello");
assert_eq!(tuple.1, 5);
assert_eq!(tuple.2, 'c');

println!("{}", tuple.0);  // prints "hello"
```

## structs and enums

Structs in Rust come in three flavors: classic structs, tuple structs, and unit structs.

```rs
// A struct with named fields
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    likes_oranges: bool,
}

// A tuple struct
struct Point2D(u32, u32);

// A unit struct
struct Unit;

fn main() {
    // Instantiate a classic struct, with named fields. Order does not matter.
    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Adam"),
        likes_oranges: true,
        age: 25
    };

    // Instantiate a tuple struct by passing the values in the same order as defined.
    let origin = Point2D(0, 0);

    // Instantiate a unit struct.
    let unit = Unit;

    // Display the details of the person
    if person.likes_oranges {
        println!("{:?} is {:?} and likes oranges.", person.name, person.age);  
    } else {
        println!("{:?} is {:?} and doesn't like oranges.", person.name, person.age);  
    }
}
```

The `enum` keyword allows the creation of a type, which might be one of a few different variants. Enum variants, just like structs, can have fields with names, fields without names, or no fields at all.

```rs
enum WebEvent {
    // An enum can be unit-like
    PageLoad,
    PageUnload,

    // Or it can include characters and strings
    KeyPress(char),
    Paste(String),

    // Or it can include tuple structs
    Click{x: i64, y: i64}
}
```
